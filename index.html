  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my cool website</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is Steven</li>
    <li>In my previous career I performed missile warning and space surveillance functions for the military</li>
    <li>From this course I hope to learn basic skills needed to help me become an entry level software developer </li>
    <li>Three fun facts about me are my support for Denver Nuggets and Colorado Rockies sports without having lived in
      Colorado. Second, I have participated in organized baseball, basketball, and soccer growing up as a youth. I was
      also pretty decent at football, tennis and other sports. Finally, I used to own a motorized Honda Scooter and had
      a collection of over 5,000 baseball cards as a youth.</li>
